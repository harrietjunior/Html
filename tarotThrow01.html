<table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="750"><tbody><tr><td><br></td>
<td valign="top"><b>10 Querent: </b>External cirumstances. Discimination, avarice<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/disks11growth.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>11 Disks: </b>The
princess spins, symbolizing the creative growth made possible by the
cooperative and intelligent use of natural resources, both internal and
external. Behind the bull of fertility is a field of sheep, a God-given
natural resource </td>
<td><br></td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>9 Subconscious: </b>Hidden motivation, worries. Independence, idleness<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/cups06satisfaction.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>6 Cups: </b>Six
cups are joined at their bases, forming a wheel. They receive from
above red liquid, blood or wine, and pass it down. Each cup gives out
light from the sun at the center of the wheel. As the wheel turns, the
liquid flows to other levels but remains the same; there is always
enough</td>
<td><br></td>
<td valign="top"><b>8 Mental: </b>Language, learning. What effects the mind, the way you use your mind<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/17star.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>17 Major: </b>Following
the period of instability (Tower), which invariably led to much inner
questioning, many of us in fear and relief turn to constructing another
Tower, again on our old ways of thinking. The Star helps us to see how
we may avoid this. It is the card of meditation, inner reflection. For
the first time we see the subconscious naked, bathed only in the
starlight of the cosmic night. The symbol of Thoth, the Egyptian god of
truth, flies past, and the mountain of attainment appears to be nearer.
The figure gazes at her reflection in the pool of the waters of life
and finds at her crown the reflection of the Star, giver of universal
light. She has turned her back on the world and gazes calmly within.
Meanings: peaceful contemplation. The Star of the soul, lighting the
way from within. Stilling oneself; listening</td>

<td valign="top"><b>7 Emotion: </b>Rationalization and false reasoning can attempt to curb emotions. Unselfishness, lust<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/disks02unity.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>2 Disks: </b>The
figure 2, made of a rose stem, bears a white rose for purity and
divinity, and a red rose for earthly nature, representing the union of
the pure desire of the spirit with the personal desire of the self</td>
<td><br></td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>6 Heart: </b>Interpretation varies from mundane materialism to divine worship. Devotion, pride<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/swords01energy.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>1 Swords: </b>A
downward pointing sword is framed by the letter A. Four feathers
symbolize the four elements that are carried by the velocity of the
swords. The letter A is connected historically with the image of an ox,
symbol of vigor and activity</td>
<td><br></td>
<td valign="top"><b>5 Change: </b>Associated with fear, but does not have to be destructive. Can indicate a previously unrealized destructive behavior pattern<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/00fool.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>0 Major: </b>The
Fool is a symbolic picture of the "divine spark," the ancient child
soul of man. He is shown before the fall into manifestation, playing
wtih the symbols of the elements as if they were toys. Meanings: in
number 1 position, the subject's evolutionary journey through life. In
position 10, the folly of proceeding on a course of action while
ignoring the likely pitfalls. The nature of folly and wisdom.
Frankness. Innocence</td>

<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/disks08skill.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>8 Disks: </b>The
figure of Mercury has apparently constructed the 8 from metal with a
hammer and chisel. Sparks fly from the blows of the hammer and the disk
symbols are shown as holes in the eight. The chessboard background and
Mercury's physical labor suggest mental skill being applied to physical
work</td>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>3 Feminine: </b>Mother. Born into a situation. Silence, avarice<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/wands12aspiration.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>12 Wands: </b>The
princely archer drops his bow of self and follows the arrow of fire.
His heels are winged. Purity of desire is indicated by the white belt
with the insignia of the sun. His clothes are golden, a reference to
the alchemical transmutation of base metals to gold, and to his royal
birth</td>
<td><br></td>
<td valign="top"><b>2 Masculine: </b>Father. Outward self. Associated with spiritual aspirations. Devotion<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/wands08speed.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>8 Wands: </b>Eight
wands circle inside a figure eight. Thought can grasp a concept or
travel to a distant place in a flash. Fast movement generates friction,
friction causes sparks; another of the mind's qualities is the sudden
flash of insight</td>

<td valign="top"><b>1 Alpha Omega: </b>Root cause. Completion<br>
<img src="Tarot_13Swords_files/swords13reason.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 280px;"><br><b>13 Swords: </b>The
queen, red-haired to indicate vibrant activity, is dressed in blue to
symbolize intelligence. A symbol of alchemy is by her throne to
indicate that her reasoning encompasses all levels including the
qualities of the soul and compassion. Her power leads one to truthful
self-analysis and faith in the evolution of the soul toward its creator</td>
