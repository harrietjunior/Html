DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little<br>
 dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am<br>
 forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is<br>
 the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining<br>
 the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another<br>
 houseplant.<p>
DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around<br>
 their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try<br>
 this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse<br>
 these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their<br>
 favorite chair... must try this on their bed.<p>
DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no<br>
 good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it<br>
 included a burning foamy chemical called "shampoo." What sick<br>
 minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece of<br>
 thumb still stuck between my teeth.<p>
DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe<br>
 snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to<br>
 return. He is obviously a half-wit. The bird on the other hand has<br>
 got to be an informant, and speaks with them regularly. I am certain<br>
 he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal<br>
 room his safety is assured. But I can wait, it is only a matter of time.<br>
